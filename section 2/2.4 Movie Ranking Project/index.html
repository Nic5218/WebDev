<h2> My Top 3 Movies of All-time. </h2>
<hr />
<h3> Stand By Me </h3>
<p> Beautiful and fragile, a coming-of-age movie. River Phoenix gave his best performance on screen. </p>
<h3> Blade Runner </h3>
<p> The most unforgettable death scene. Very philosophical discussion about what it means to be a human and to be alive.</p>
<h3> Amelie Poulain </h3>
<p> Very sweet and imaginative French movie. </p>
